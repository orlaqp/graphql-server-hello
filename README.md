# A quick example of how to use Apollo Server/Client together with Angular 2 with CORs support

### First

`cd server`
`npm install`
`npm start`

the open an extra terminal window:

`cd client`
`npm install`
`npm start`

Open the development tools (I used a Mac with chrome, so basivally press Cmd + Shift + I). Open the following address:

`http://localhost:8080`

you see the app stop right where the data is retrieved from the server using `graphql`

I hope you can get the idea and use this project to understand how to build your apps using graphql/

Enjoy!
